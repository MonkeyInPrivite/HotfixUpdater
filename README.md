HotfixUpdater is a simple on-device Hotfix updater for Kindles, automating the process of version checking, downloading, running, and initialising the Hotfix, inspired by code from MRPI.

## Installation

2. Unzip it, paste both `HotfixUpdater.sh` and `HotfixUpdater/` into the `documents/` folder on your Kindle.
3. Run the scriptlet, and watch it go!

## Prerequisites

- Recommended; AdBreak, WinterBreak
- Universal Hotfix to run it initially
- 5.12.2.2 And Above.

## Notes

- Prior to submitting a bug report regarding the Scriptlet, try updating to the latest Hotfix manually to see if that fixes your issue.
